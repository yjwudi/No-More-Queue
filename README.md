# No-More-Queue
No-More-Queue is a data processing software. It's used for process the data from the canteen, using regression forecasting and cluster algorithm. In regression forecasting, the software will forecast the income in the next week for every window. In cluster, the software will get the connections between windows.<br>
The manager of the canteen can use the software to analyze the data, to allocate the number of staffes in different window based on the regression forecasting, to reallocate the position of different windows based on the cluster.<br>
The data should be formated, which is stored in the regression.nmq and cluster.nmq file.<br>
I used some python libraries to develop the software: PySide, Numpy, Pyqtgraph and Scikit-learn.
